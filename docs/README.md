# XDR Configuration & Security Gap Assessment

## Executive Summary

This repository documents a simulated Security Assurance engagement focused on evaluating the configuration, telemetry integrity, and detection effectiveness of an enterprise XDR deployment.

The purpose of this assessment is to identify control weaknesses, visibility gaps, misconfigurations, and detection deficiencies across endpoint, identity, and cloud security layers. Findings are risk-ranked and aligned with practical remediation guidance.

---

## Objectives

- Validate asset inventory and telemetry coverage
- Assess Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configuration posture
- Review Microsoft Sentinel data ingestion and analytic rule effectiveness
- Evaluate Azure / Entra ID identity security controls
- Conduct controlled detection validation testing
- Perform structured security gap analysis
- Produce a prioritized remediation roadmap

## Technologies in Scope

| Platform | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) | Endpoint protection & EDR telemetry |
| Microsoft Sentinel | SIEM & analytics platform |
| Azure / Entra ID | Identity & access control |
| Endpoint Telemetry | Behavioral and security event collection |
| Detection Rules & Analytics | Threat identification logic |

## Methodology

The assessment follows a structured assurance lifecycle:

1. **Asset & Telemetry Inventory Validation**
2. **Configuration & Hardening Review**
3. **Detection Effectiveness Testing**
4. **Security Gap Analysis**
5. **Risk Prioritization & Remediation Planning**

Each phase is documented within the `/docs` directory.

## Engagement Model

This project is structured to mirror a real-world client security assurance engagement, emphasizing:

- Structured documentation
- Evidence-based analysis
- Risk-driven evaluation
- Clear executive-level reporting
